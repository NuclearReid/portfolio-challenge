# Reid Back Portfolio

This project was about creating a portfolio that included internal links to parts of the webpage and external links. The original intention is for the links of the projects to link to work that we have done. I have not any projects so I just have the links going to my github profile.

## The design

The idea behind my design is that if have my bio on the left and a tablet/iPad on the right. The apps I have/will create are supposed to look like the apps on the home screen of the tablet. I made them move so the user would be aware they would lead them somewhere. 

### Images and a Link

(These images are a little out of date. I have updated the code to have the little projects be titled Project 2-5)

#### Graphics used

All graphics and images used have been created by me.


##### Pitfalls
The images on the page take a long time to render. I don’t fully know why. Maybe because they are too big? I will figure out the reason and find a solution at a later date. (the project is due today and I don’t have time)
